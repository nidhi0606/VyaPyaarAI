### üß† How It Works
**OUR VISION**
Our smart selling assistant is powered by a combination of AI and real-time web scraping. When you enter your product details, our system uses the Google Gemini LLM API to understand the product and generate AI-powered descriptions and suggestions.

**OUR MISSION**
Simultaneously, we perform live price scraping from Meesho using Playwright to analyze real competitor pricing data for similar products. Using this data, we run smart pricing algorithms that suggest the most profitable and competitive price range for your selected selling platform.

Note on Scraping Feature in Deployment
The product price scraping feature showcased in our demo video is fully functional when running the project locally. It uses Playwright-based scraping combined with live competitor analysis from platforms like Meesho.

However, in the deployed version, this scraping functionality is disabled due to the following reasons:

Server-Side Restrictions: Web scraping requires headless browser execution (via Playwright), which demands specific dependencies and system-level permissions not supported on free-tier deployment platforms like Render or Vercel.

Cold Start & Execution Time: Free-tier services often kill inactive containers and have strict timeouts, making scraping unstable or non-functional.

Browserless Environment: These platforms do not allow headless browsers like Chromium to run smoothly without custom server setup and persistent environments.

‚úÖ To experience full scraping functionality, please run the project locally by cloning the repo and following the setup instructions below.


## üì¶ Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your system:

- Node.js (v18 or above) ‚Äî [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)  
- npm (comes with Node.js)  
- Internet connection (needed for scraping Meesho data)
